## 🏗️ Architecture

###  Implementation

- ** Implementation**: React TypeScript frontend (`frontend/`) - modular and component-based

### Tech Stack (Modern Frontend)
- **React 19** with TypeScript 5.x
- **Vite 6.x** for build tooling and development server
- **Tailwind CSS 4.x** for styling
- **Zustand 5.x** for state management with persistence
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Chart.js** for data visualization
- **React Router DOM** for navigation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd empire-builder
```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Build Your Kingdom**: Start with your castle in the center. Place buildings around it to generate income and recruit heroes.

2. **Recruit Heroes**: Build guilds (Warrior, Ranger, Wizard, Rogue) to recruit heroes. Each hero class has unique stats and preferences.

3. **Place Flags**: Use flags to guide hero behavior:
   - **Attack Flag** (Red): Directs heroes to engage enemies
   - **Explore Flag** (Green): Encourages exploration and discovery
   - **Defend Flag** (Blue): Positions heroes for defense

4. **Manage Resources**: Collect gold from your buildings to fund expansion and hero recruitment.

5. **Defend Your Kingdom**: Enemies will spawn periodically. Your heroes will automatically engage based on their preferences and flag assignments.
